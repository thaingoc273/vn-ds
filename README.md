# LLMs Prompting from Manual to Automatic

This repository provides a tutorial on transitioning from manual to automatic prompting techniques for Large Language Models (LLMs). Follow the steps below to set up your environment and get started.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Bash**: Ensure you have a Bash shell available on your system.
- **Python**: A Python installation is required. If you don't have Python installed, the setup script will download a standalone Python executable for you.

### Setting Up the Environment

#### Option 1: Automated Setup (Recommended)
Run the following command to automatically set up a virtual environment and install dependencies:
```bash
bash scripts/create_venv.sh
```

**Note**: This script will:
1. Download a standalone Python executable (if needed).
2. Create a virtual environment.
3. Install all required dependencies.

You may be prompted to enter your password to run the script with `sudo`. This is necessary for installing system-level dependencies.

#### Option 2: Manual Setup
If you prefer to use an existing Python installation, follow these steps:

1. Create a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python -m venv .venv
    ```
2. Activate the virtual environment:
    ```bash
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Running the Tutorial
Once the environment is set up, you can start exploring the tutorial materials. Refer to the `notebooks/` directory for detailed instructions and examples.
