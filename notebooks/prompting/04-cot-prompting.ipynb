        "## Overview\n",
        "\n",
        "This tutorial delves into Chain of Thought (CoT) prompting, an advanced technique in prompt engineering that guides AI models to dissect complex problems into detailed, step-by-step reasoning processes. We'll explore the implementation of CoT prompting using Google's Gemini via OpenRouter and LangChain.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Motivation\n",
        "\n",
        "With the rapid advancement of AI language models, there's a growing demand for outputs that are more transparent, logical, and verifiable. CoT prompting addresses this need by encouraging models to articulate their thought process, similar to how humans tackle complex problems. This approach not only enhances the accuracy of AI-generated responses but also increases their interpretability and reliability.\n",
