        "## Motivation\n",
        "\n",
        "In the rapidly evolving field of artificial intelligence, the ability to generate structured outputs from language models is becoming increasingly important. Structured outputs allow for more precise and interpretable results, which are essential for applications ranging from data extraction to automated decision-making.\n",

        "## Key Components\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Understanding how to invoke specific functions within a language model to generate structured outputs.\n",
        "2. Methods for ensuring that the generated outputs conform to the expected structure and format.\n",
        "3. Practical examples of integrating structured output generation with popular frameworks like LangChain and OpenRouter."
