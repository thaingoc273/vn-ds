        "## Overview\n",
        "\n",
        "This tutorial explores two essential prompt structures used in AI interactions:\n",
        "1. Single-turn prompts\n",
        "2. Multi-turn prompts (conversations)\n",
        "\n",
        "We'll utilize Gemini Pro 1.5 via OpenRouter and LangChain to illustrate these concepts.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Motivation\n",
        "\n",
        "Grasping various prompt structures is essential for effective AI communication. Single-turn prompts excel in quick, direct queries, while multi-turn prompts facilitate more nuanced, context-rich exchanges. Proficiency in these structures enhances the versatility and efficacy of AI applications across diverse scenarios.\n",

        "1. **Single-turn Prompts**: One-time interactions with the AI model.\n",
        "2. **Multi-turn Prompts**: Sequential exchanges that preserve context.\n",
        "3. **Prompt Templates**: Standardized structures for consistent AI querying.\n",
